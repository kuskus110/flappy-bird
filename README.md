# Flappy Bird Game
A Flappy Bird clone, made with Unity, for the purpose of learning.

[My game on Unity Play](https://play.unity.com/mg/other/flappy-bird-23)

## Description
After learning the basics of Unity, I thought I would learn a lot by building a clone of some simple game. Indeed I learned and explored a bunch of Unity and general game dev basic skills during the process of making this game. 

## Help me learn and improve
If you are an experienced Unity developer, or C# developer I would be very glad to recieve comments and review about my project and code. Help me learn :)


## My recommendation for learning
If you want to learn game dev I strongly recommend you to build Flappy Bird (or some other relatively simple game).

I recommend doing it with these next rules:

* Learn the basics of Unity before you start ([Create With Code unit 1](https://learn.unity.com/course/create-with-code) is a great tutorial, that's what I completed before making Flappy Bird). Don't try to start without the basic knowledge of Unity and game dev.
* In addition to the previous rule: Don't spend a lot of time learning every little bit of Unity, learn only the very basics and dive in the water.
* Read, explore, and deeply understand everything you do. (My main source of help was Unity Manual and scripting API).
* Don't use a step by step tutorial. It will cause you to not remember the basics, and you won't be able to build alone your next game.
* Make progress with small steps and don't give up!


If you are starting/want to start learning, contact me and maybe I can help with your journey of learning game development with Unity :)
